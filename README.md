# advent-of-code
I am biochemist by training, but I am gradually transitioning into computational biology.
I started my coding journey by learning Python through Advent of Code challenges. Some of the earliest files in this repository may not be as well-structured as the more recent ones. However, over time I've gained more experience, and my understanding of better practices has evolved significantly.
I don't always use the most efficient or "best" solutions. Instead, I sometimes treat certain tasks as a playground to practice particular data structures or concepts. This repository reflects my learning process and growth in coding.
